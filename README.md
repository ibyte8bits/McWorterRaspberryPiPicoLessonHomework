Find out the least time the LED can be lit to be able to see it.  
The LED can only be turned on and off as quickly as the Pico can 
turn it on and off. 

This turned out to be 946 ticks.  Each tick on the Pico is one 
millisecond.  The least time from experimentation is one half
of 946 milliseconds or 473 milliseconds.
